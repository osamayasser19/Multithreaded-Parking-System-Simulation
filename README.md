1. Parking Lot Setup and Semaphore Management

Tasks:

Set up a parking lot with 4 parking spots.

Implement a semaphore to manage these spots and prevent race conditions.

Ensure that only 4 cars are parked simultaneously.


Easy Part: Setting up the initial parking lot structure and creating the semaphore.

Challenging Part: Managing the semaphore effectively so that it prevents race conditions in a multithreaded environment.


2. Gate and Car Threads Implementation

Tasks:

Create separate threads to simulate the car arrivals for each of the three gates.

Ensure each car is represented by a thread that attempts to park, stays for a duration, and then exits.


Easy Part: Creating the threads and assigning them to each gate.

Challenging Part: Synchronizing thread activities, especially when multiple cars try to enter the limited spots simultaneously.


3. Timing and Simulation of Car Arrivals and Parking Duration

Tasks:

Use sleep functions to simulate arrival times and parking durations as defined in the input file.

Read and parse the car arrival schedule from an input text file.


Easy Part: Using sleep() for timing.

Challenging Part: Parsing the input file accurately and handling any edge cases where the timing may create conflicts.


4. Logging, Reporting, and Final Status Output

Tasks:

Log each carâ€™s actions (arrival, parking, waiting, departure).

Report the number of cars currently in the parking lot and the total number served at the end of the simulation.


Easy Part: Creating the basic log messages and setting up counters.

Challenging Part: Ensuring logs are accurate in a concurrent environment and managing the final status report to reflect accurate counts.


By dividing these parts, each team member can focus on a specific functionality, making it manageable.
